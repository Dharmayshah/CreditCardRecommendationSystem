Project: Credit Card Recommendation Chatbot
Objective
Build a conversational chatbot that helps a user find the best credit card based on their needs by chatting naturally.
The chatbot must use a fixed JSON dataset of 50 credit cards and LangChain to interpret user intent, extract preferences, and recommend the most suitable card.
The goal is clarity of thinking, clean architecture, and correct use of LLMs, not UI polish.
________________


What the Chatbot Should Do
* Chat with the user in natural language
* Ask only necessary follow-up questions (income, spend type, preferences, etc.)
* Understand vague inputs (e.g. “shopping”, “travel”, “low fees”)
* Filter and rank cards only from the provided JSON
* Recommend one best card with a short explanation
* Never hallucinate cards or features outside the dataset
________________


Input Data
* A single JSON file containing 50 credit cards
* Each card includes structured fields such as:
   * Issuer
   * Fees
   * Rewards
   * Interest rate
   * Eligibility (income / employment)
   * Card category (shopping, travel, lifestyle, etc.)
The dataset is the only source of truth.

Technical Requirements
* Language: Python
* Framework: LangChain
* LLM: Any supported model (OpenAI / Gemini / Claude — configurable)
* No database required (JSON in-memory is sufficient)
* CLI or simple chat loop is acceptable (no frontend needed)
________________


Suggested Architecture (High Level)
1. User Message
2. LLM + Prompt
   * Extract user preferences into structured fields
3. Filtering Logic
   * Match cards from JSON based on extracted preferences
4. Scoring / Ranking
   * Simple rule-based or weighted scoring
5. Final Recommendation
   * Return one card with reasoning
